# SurveyCogModel - Proposal
### 'A Survey of Computational Models of Cognition'
This project serves as an umbrella under which several smaller projects will take place. 

#### Driving Questions 
1. How did modeling cognitive processes evolve?
   1. What languages and software were available that enabled or limited these models?
   1. What hardware enabled or limited these models?
1. What are existing taxonomies for discussing cognitive models?
   1. What are they lacking? What could be improved?
1. What developments in other fields influenced cognitive models?
   1. Neuroscience, "AI", "cognitive science", philosophy, linguistics, anthropology (?)

This project is mostly designed to cover questions #1 and #2, where as #3 is perhaps more covered by the Cognition Study Group, but #3 is mentioned as it completes the picture of how cognition models evolved. 

### Methods
Methods will include the creation of annotated bibliographies, aggregate reports/manuscripts for project parts, and associated code (notebooks) when available for manipulation of code.



## Sub Projects / Parts 
- 0: Planning and Framing
- ?: Background: Pre-computer & Philosophical landscape
- ?: 1940-50s
- ?: 1960s
- ?: 1970 / 80s / 90s / 00s / 10s
- ?: 2020+ "The Next Decade in AI" - Gary Marcus


## Part 0: Framing the Project
- Project categorization: outside of breaking things down by essentially decades chronologically, what are better ways to divide or demarcate boundaries, trends, or trajectories?
